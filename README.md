# Crawl Out

Welcome to Crawl Out, a pixelated adventure where danger lurks in every shadow, and treasures await the brave and the bold.

In a distant realm, a legendary dungeon lies hidden beneath the ruins of an ancient fortress. Once a thriving kingdom, it now stands as a desolate labyrinth, crawling with undead horrors. Rumors speak of untold treasures buried deep within its dark and twisted corridors, guarded by a relentless horde of zombies. Many adventurers have ventured into the dungeon, but none have returned to tell the tale.
